## Summary

This project proposes a digital quantum algorithm for simulating time evolution of a completely anisotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian on an arbitrary lattice. Experiments were performed on IBM Q devices, by means of Qiskit SDK, and fidelities grater than 80% were obtained for spin chains with up to 4 lattice sites. Moreover, the gate count is significantly improved over similar algorithms, and by the nature of the gates used, transpilation is quite cost-effective. As an interesting application of quantum time evolution, the quantum algorithm is used as a quantum node for producin thermal states of a magnetic lattice describe by a Heisenberg-like model.

## Justification

Quantum Computing has become a reality now that the field is entering the so called NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Quantum) era. Among many models of quantum computations, the digital quantum circuit model is one of the most extended and discussed. It is based upon the concept of **qubit**, which is an abstract two-level quantum system. By profitting linear superposition and entanglement of may-qubit systems, quantum algorithms are claimed to be more resource-effcient than standard classical algorithms in areas like machine learning and mathematical finance.

Although there is general excitement regarding the possibility of enhancing AI and data science with quantum computing, the present project studies a more fundamental, yet quite versatile, application of quantum computation: simulation of quantum physical systems. This perspective was introduced in 1982 by Richard Feynman. He suggested that using a quantum system to simulate another can reduce the exponential overhead that occurs by incrementing the number of components. In particular, simulation of a Heisenberg Hamiltonian on an arbitrary graph is considered in the context of the quantum circuit model.

Although this Hamiltonian is far simpler than arbitrary N-qubit systems Hamiltonians, it can be readily generalized to produce interesting behavior. For instance, it is well known that a Heisenberg chain exhibits a quantum phase transition at cero temperature. Moreover, by allowing next-to-nearest-neighbour interactions, a Haeisenber Hamiltonian can be used in applications such as Machine Learning based upon Boltzman Machines. In the present work, a parametric Heisenberg Model is simulated, thus openning the possibility of extending the algorithm to the field of Quantum Machine Learning.

In particular, the recently proposed Variational Quantum Thermalizer (VQT) is considered for producing thermal states of a magnetic system. A Quantum Neural Network (QNN) based upon time evolution of a parametric Heisenberg Hamiltonian is used to learn the thermal states of a magnetic system in a 2D system with non-square topology. In consequence, time evolution of an elementary Hamiltonian is used to study thermal properties of a quantum system, thus illustrating the potential of digital quantum computation in material science.
