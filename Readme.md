# Time Simulation of Heisenberg Model in a Quantum Computer

This repository is used to log all my work in the completion of my undergraduate thesis at Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Sede Bogot√°. It contains:

* A log of my weekly work in this respect.
* A document with the thesis proposal.
* A folder with the Jupyter notebooks used to simulate algorithms.

## Prerrequisites

To reproduce the results of this repository, the system requierments are:

* Python 3.x (Conda/miniconda Distribution)
* Qiskit 0.11.0 (Or newer)

I ran the notebooks locally using ```qasm_simulator``` from Qiskit.
