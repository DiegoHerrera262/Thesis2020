This work proposes a digital quantum algorithm for simulating time evolution of a completely anisotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian on an arbitrary lattice. Experiments were performed on IBM Q devices, and fidelities greater than 80\% were obtained for spin chains with up to 4 lattice sites. Moreover, the gate count is significantly improved over similar algorithms, and by the nature of the gates used, transpilation to IBM Q devices is quite cost effective. As an interesting application, the algorithm is used to construct a quantum node for producing thermal states of a magnetic lattice whose dynamics is governed by a Heisenberg-like Hamiltonian.
