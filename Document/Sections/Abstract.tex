A digital quantum algorithm for simulating time evolution of a completely anisotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian on an arbitrary lattice is proposed. This consists on a second order Trotter scheme that profits commutation properties of spin-spin interaction. The implementation is tailored for publicly available quantum processors provided by \textbf{IBM Quantum Experience}. Recent techniques for implementing high fidelity cross resonance gates are used to reduce execution time on real quantum backends, thus taking more advantage of the finite coherence time of current quantum devices. The proposed algorithm is compared to direct implementations based on direct evolution of Pauli components of the Hamiltonian, and basis sets used by IBM Quantum backends. This work also discusses the limitations of Trotterization error using QASM simulators, and the inherent errors of noisy hardware implementation.
